    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dry yeast</li>
        <li>1/4 cup warm water (105°)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable shortening</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup boiling water</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>Powdered sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>  Sprinkle yeast over warm water in a small bowl, stirring to dissolve. Let stand for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine sugar, shortening, salt, heavy cream, egg, flour and boiling water in a large bowl; stir in yeast mixture. With the dough hook attachment of an electric mixer on medium speed, mix the dough just until combined and smooth. Let dough rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Roll to 1/4-inch thickness and cut individual beignets with a Mickey Mouse-shaped cutter or cut into 2 1/2 to 3-inch squares. Cover with a towel and let dough rise until doubled in size in a warm, draft-free area, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. </li>
        <li>Using caution, heat 3 inches of vegetable oil to 350°F in a deep, heavy pot over medium-high heat. Fry beignets until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes, turning as soon as they brown on one side. Remove with tongs and place on paper towels to drain.  Dust warm beignets with powdered sugar and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
